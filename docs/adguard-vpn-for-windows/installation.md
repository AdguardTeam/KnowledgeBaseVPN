### Advanced uninstallation {#advanced}

In case regular uninstall doesn't work for any reason, you can try to use an advanced method. First of all, you need to [download the uninstaller tool](https://cdn.adtidy.org/distr/windows/Uninstall_Utility.zip) created by our developers. Extract the archive to any folder on your PC, run the **Adguard.UninstallUtility.exe** file, and allow the app to make changes to your device. Then follow the instruction below:

- Choose *Standard uninstall*, ***Delete AdGuard VPN*** and click *Uninstall*

- Wait until uninstall is finished
