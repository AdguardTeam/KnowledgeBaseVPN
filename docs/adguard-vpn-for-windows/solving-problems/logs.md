If you encounter a problem when using AdGuard VPN for Windows, you can inform us about it. We would be grateful if you also send application logs our way, they help us resolving problems much quicker.


## Collecting and sending standard logs

By default, AdGuard VPN for Windows uses the standard logging level, that is, the basic collection of data about running processes of the app. To send these logs, follow the next steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for Windows and, if possible, repeat the actions that led to the error. Note the exact time when this error occurred.

2. Click **Support** (in the menu above) → **Report a bug**.

3. In the opened form, enter your email address for feedback and describe the error found, including the time when this error occurred. If you can't reproduce the problem, specify as accurately as possible when it last occurred.

4. There is a check mark next to the **Send detailed system info**, which means that when you send a report, you also send logs.

>If for some reason it is more convenient for you to send us logs in another way, you can export them yourself. To do this, go to **Support** → **Export logs and system info**.


## Collecting and sending extended logs

In most cases, the default logging level is sufficient to trace down possible bugs. But there are cases when more detailed technical information about the device and connections is required, and then our support team will ask you to enable the extended logging level. To send this type of logs, follow these steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for Windows and select **Settings** (in the menu above) → **App settings** → **Advanced settings** → **Logging level**.

2. In the **Logging level** section, select **Record everything**.

3. Repeat the actions that led to the error, and note the time when it occurred.

4. Switch the logging level back to **Record by default**.

5. Then select **Support** (in the menu above) → **Report a bug**.

6. In the opened form, enter your email address for feedback and describe the error found, including the time when this error occurred.

7. Make sure that there is a check mark next to **Send detailed system info** and click **Send**.
