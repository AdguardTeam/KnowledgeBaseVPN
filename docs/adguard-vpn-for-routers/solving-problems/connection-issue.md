AdGuard VPN uses the IKEv2 protocol, which may be restricted in Belarus, Kazakhstan, or Russia. If you are located in one of these countries and see a *No connection* message, we strongly recommend that you install [AdGuard VPN apps](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/products.html) directly on your other devices. For its apps, AdGuard VPN uses its proprietary protocol that is much harder to detect and block.

If you are in another country and can’t connect to AdGuard VPN on your router, please make sure your router supports IKEv2. If it does and the problem persists, please contact support at [support@adguard-vpn.com](support@adguard-vpn.com).

You can also connect to our servers using [AdGuard VPN for Linux](/adguard-vpn-for-linux/setting-up-on-a-router), which supports many Keenetic, OpenWRT, and Asuswrt-Merlin routers. To make sure your router offers the support for AdGuard VPN, check if you can install **Entware**, a package manager required to install the AdGuard VPN on your router. If so, they’re likely compatible.
