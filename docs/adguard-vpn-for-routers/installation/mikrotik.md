To set up AdGuard VPN on your MikroTik router, follow these steps:

1. Open the MikroTik terminal. You can do this by using the command line or Terminal on your computer and entering: `ssh admin@192.168.88.1`. Alternatively, you can also access it through your browser by visiting `http://192.168.88.1` and clicking on the Terminal tab in the upper right corner.

1. Once youâ€™re in, run the following commands:

 `/ip ipsec mode-config`

 `add connection-mark=to_adguard name=adguard responder=no`

 `/ip ipsec policy group`

 `add name=adguard`

 `/ip ipsec profile`

 `add name=adguard`

 `/ip ipsec peer`

 `add address=SERVER_ADDRESS exchange-mode=ike2 name=adguard profile=adguard`

 `/ip ipsec proposal`

 `add name=adguard pfs-group=none`

 `/ip ipsec identity`

 `add auth-method=eap certificate="" eap-methods=eap-mschapv2 generate-policy=port-strict mode-config=adguard peer=adguard policy-template-group=adguard username=USERNAME password=PASSWORD`

 `/ip ipsec policy`

 `add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 group=adguard src-address=0.0.0.0/0 template=yes`

In the commands above, `SERVER_ADDRESS` indicates the server address. `USERNAME` is the username that you were assigned when adding your router in your AdGuard account. The same goes for `PASSWORD`.

:::note

Please note, these commands should be executed exactly as they are.
