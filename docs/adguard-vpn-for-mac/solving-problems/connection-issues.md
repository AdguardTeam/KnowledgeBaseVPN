If you’re experiencing problems connecting to AdGuard VPN, follow these steps to resolve common issues.

## Connection problems on specific Wi-Fi networks

When AdGuard VPN isn’t working properly on a particular Wi-Fi network:

1. Check the router settings and active services. Some of them may interfere with AdGuard VPN:

- Other VPNs (running simultaneously)
- Firewalls (blocking VPN traffic)
- Network filters (for example, built-in Internet filters on Keenetic routers, refer to the [manufacturer’s guide](https://help.keenetic.com/) for details)

1. Disable conflicting services and settings

1. Restart your router and relaunch AdGuard VPN

If the problem persists, please contact the AdGuard VPN support team (**support@adguard.com**).

## Connection issues on one device

Checky system time settings — incorrect date and time may block the app from connecting to the server.

- Enable automatic time synchronization
- Manually set correct time if needed

If the problem persists, please contact the AdGuard VPN support team (**support@adguard.com**).

## Connection issues only on macOS

If you can’t connect to AdGuard VPN on macOS, there might be two solutions:

1. Disable *Screen time*. Follow [Apple’s official guide](https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/guide/mac-help/mchl7a0a2743/15.0/mac/15.0) for details.

1. Temporarily disable other software. Common conflicts include:

- Antivirus programs
- Proxy tools
- Firewalls and third-party DNS services

Restart your PC and check if the issue is resolved. If the problem persists, please contact the AdGuard VPN support team (**support@adguard.com**).
