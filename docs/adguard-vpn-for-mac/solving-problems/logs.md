If you encounter any problems while using AdGuard VPN for Mac, you can inform us about it by sending application logs.

## Standard logs

By default, AdGuard VPN for Mac uses the standard logging level, that is, the basic collection of data about running processes of the app. To send these logs, follow the next steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for Mac and, if possible, repeat the actions that led to the error. Note the exact time when this error occurred.

1. Click **Support** (in the menu above) → **Report a bug**.

1. In the opened form, enter your email address for feedback and describe the error found, including the time when this error occurred. If you can’t reproduce the problem, specify as accurately as possible when it last occurred.

1. There is a check mark next to the **Send detailed system info**, which means that when you send a report, you also send logs.

:::note

If for some reason it is more convenient for you to send us logs in another way, you can export them yourself. To do this, select **Settings** → **App settings** → **Advanced settings** → **Export logs and system info**.

## Extended logs

In most cases, the default logging level is sufficient to trace down possible bugs. But there are cases when more detailed technical information about the device and connections is required, and then our support team will ask you to enable the extended logging level. To send this type of logs, follow these steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for Mac and select **Settings** → **App settings** → **Advanced settings**.

1. In the **Logging level** pop-up window, select **Extended**.

1. Repeat the actions that led to the error, and note the time when it occurred.

1. Switch the logging level back to **Default**.

1. Then select **Support** (in the menu above) → **Report a bug**.

1. In the opened form, enter your email address for feedback and describe the error found, including the time when this error occurred.

1. Make sure that there is a check mark next to **Send detailed system info** and click **Send**.
