AdGuard VPN has the General operating mode enabled by default, which uses its own [AdGuard VPN protocol](/general/adguard-vpn-protocol.md). It provides the best combination of connection speed and security. 

However, General operating mode does not allow AdGuard VPN and AdGuard ad blocker to work simultaneously. 

The Integrated mode, in turn, uses the IPsec protocol, which makes it possible for the AdGuard applications to work together. If you already have AdGuard ad blocker when installing AdGuard VPN, this mode will turn on automatically and allow you to use our applications at the same time. If you first installed AdGuard VPN, and only then decided to try AdGuard ad blocker, then to use them together, follow these steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for iOS and select "Settings" in the lower-right corner of the screen.

2. Go to "App settings" and select "Operating mode".

3. Switch the mode from *General* to *Integrated*. Done!

>Note that in **Integrated** mode you can't use the Exclusions feature or the DNS server feature.
