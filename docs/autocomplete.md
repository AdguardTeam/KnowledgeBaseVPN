To make navigating through different and, sometimes, pretty long commands easier, you can use the command-line completion feature.

To enable it, see the bash-completion hint that is shown after installing or updating AdGuard VPN for Linux:

To use the feature, just start typing the command you want and hit the Tab ↹ key — the command will automatically complete with a necessary word or will show a choice of completion options.
