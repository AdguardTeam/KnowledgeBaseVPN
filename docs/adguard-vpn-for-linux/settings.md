## Crash reports

If you enable automatic crash reports, AdGuard VPN will notify the developers if something goes wrong. To enable the setting, type:

## Hints

AdGuard VPN can show you hints after executing commands â€” for example, what to do next or how to fix an error. This setting is enabled by default but you can disable it by typing:

To re-enable it, replace `off` with `on`.

## Debug logging

To report a bug, you may need to share debug logs with the developers or support team. To enable debug logging, type:

Disable this setting after exporting logs.
