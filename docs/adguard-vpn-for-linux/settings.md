You can manage AdGuard VPN for Linux settings from the command line. To view the current configuration, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config show

## VPN mode: TUN or SOCKS5

You can choose how AdGuard VPN routes traffic.

To set the default tunnel mode, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-mode TUN

To set the SOCKS5 mode, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-mode SOCKS

To set the SOCKS5 port, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-socks-port <port_number>

Replace `<port_number>` with the port you want to connect to.

## DNS upstream address

To set a DNS upstream, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-dns <server_address>

Replace `<server_address>` with the address of your DNS server. To use this DNS server at the system level, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-system-dns on

## No-route mode

This feature routes only your specified addresses through the VPN tunnel. To enable the no-route mode, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-no-routes on

## Crash reports

If you enable automatic crash reports, AdGuard VPN will notify the developers if something goes wrong. To enable the setting, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config send-reports on

To disable it, set it to `off`.

## Update channel

To change the update channel, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-update-channel <channel>

Replace `<channel>` with `stable`, `beta`, or `nightly`, depending on your preferences.

## Hints

AdGuard VPN can show you hints after executing commands â€” for example, what to do next or how to fix an error. This setting is enabled by default but you can disable it by typing:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-show-hints off

To re-enable it, replace `off` with `on`.

## Debug logging

To report a bug, you may need to share debug logs with the developers or support team. To enable debug logging, type:

    adguardvpn-cli config set-debug-logging on

Disable this setting after exporting logs.
