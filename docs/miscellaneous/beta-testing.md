There is an AdGuard VPN app for virtually every major platform out there, and we regularly release updates for all of them. This would not be possible without beta and nightly testing and, more importantly, without our testers. Want to become one of them? Here's how you can do it.

### Beta or nightly: what is the difference?

Both beta and nightly testing are important to make AdGuard VPN constantly better. However, they are different, and you can choose the one that suits you more.

The development process follows a progression from nightly to beta and then from beta to the final, stable version. It means that you are more likely to find bugs in the nightly builds, but you get access to new features faster, almost on a daily basis. On the other hand, the beta is more stable, but you will get updates less often.

### How to become a beta or nightly tester

To become an AdGuard VPN tester, you only need the device on which you will install the app, and [this link to the the beta testing page](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/beta.html). There, you will find more information on how to join our program in different platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and Browser extension.

Once on the beta testing page, all you have to do is choose between the beta and the nightly versions, download the respective build and fill up the [form](https://surveys.adguard.com/en/vpn_beta_testing_program/form.html) to apply.

::: note

To get the AdGuard for iOS beta or nightly build, first you have to install [Testflight](https://apps.apple.com/app/testflight/id899247664) on your iOS device.

### How to report a bug

If you spotted a bug on the build you are testing or just want to share your suggestion with our developers, let us know: go to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/), find a suitable repository, create a new issue there, and describe the bug/feature request in detail.

The above method preferred, but you can use others if necessary:

- Find us on [social media](https://adguardvpn-help.com/en/discuss.html). This is not the most efficient way to discuss technical matters, but we'll aways try to be helpful.

- Email our support team from the Support tab in the app or write directly to [support@adguard.com](mailto:support@adguard.com).
