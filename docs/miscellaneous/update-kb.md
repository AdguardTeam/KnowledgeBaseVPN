The goal of this Knowledgebase is to provide everyone with the most up-to-date information on all kinds of AdGuard VPN-related topics. But things constantly change, and sometimes an article doesn't reflect the current state of things anymore — there are simply not so many of us to keep an eye on every single bit of information and update it accordingly when new versions are released. 

This is why we placed all of our KB content to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN/tree/main/docs), and now literally anyone can contribute to it by suggesting edits and translations to existing articles, as well as totally new ones. For those who are unfamiliar with principles of working with GitHub, we'll provide a brief manual.

## How to suggest a change?

First things first — you will need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, join at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join). Now that this is settled, you can dive directly into writing. Navigate through the list of articles [here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN/tree/main/docs) and choose any one that you'd like to propose some changes for. Click on the text file with any article and then on the small pencil icon in the top-right corner of the frame.

Here you can finally show what you've got! Alter the article in any way you see fit (use [Markdown](https://github.com/LewisVo/Markdown-Tutorial)!), come up with a short description and a name for your soon-to-be pull request, and click on "Propose file change". You'll be taken to another page with a lot of things seemingly going on, but all you have to do is basically click the green button with "Create pull request" text on it. If you'd like to know more about the whole process, you can find plentiful GitHub tutorials online. 

If you feel lack of knowledge and would like to know more about the whole process, take some time to read [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests). 

## Writing new articles

To write a completely new article is a much more laborious task. But if you are determined to go down this path, do the following. First, make sure your article has a place in AdGuard Knowledgebase. It should be either related to one of the AdGuard VPN products in some way, or be "Meta" (examples of such "meta-articles" can be found in the [General folder](../general/how-vpn-works.md)) articles, or this one. Now, when you have found an appropriate topic, go to the [repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN) and then to the most suitable category (for example, let's say it is [AdGuard VPN for Android — Solving Problems](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN/tree/main/docs/adguard-vpn-for-android/solving-problems)). Press the "Create new file" button in the top-right part of the screen and enter the name of your file in English, in small letters, with a dash instead of spaces and `.md` at the end. 

Notice that at the top of every file there should be a certain header:

```
---
title: 'Your title here'
sidebar_position: 'Here you need to specify the number that will denote the position of the article in the side menu.'
---
```
Type the rest of the text below (use [Markdown](https://github.com/LewisVo/Markdown-Tutorial)!) and click "Propose file change" to create a PR. The rest is absolutely the same as described above.

## Translating an article

To make the process of [translating the AdGuard VPN Knowledge Base articles](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-knowledge-bases/es-ES#/kb.adguard-vpn.com) more convenient, we moved it to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project)! If you are not familiar with this platform and are not registered on it, [go to this article](adguard-translations/translate-adguard-vpn.md) for more information on the topic. 

## Working on open issues

Sometimes there's need to update or complement an existing article, or create a new one, but we can't do it right away for some reason. In such cases usually a task ("issue") gets created in special repository on GitHub. You can get there by [this link](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN/issues/), choose any issue that you find appealing and start working on it. If you have any questions — you can ask them right in the comments in that issue.
