## How to activate

To activate your AdGuard VPN subscription, follow these steps:

1. Open the AdGuard VPN app and tap *Log in or create an account*
1. On the login page that opens in your browser, enter your email address. Your subscription is linked to the email you used when purchasing AdGuard VPN. You can also log in using your Apple, Google, or Facebook account
1. Choose how you’d like to sign in: either by receiving a one-time code via email or by entering your password

That’s it! You’re now logged in and ready to enjoy AdGuard VPN.

## Resolve subscription activation issues

Sometimes users have trouble activating their subscription. Below are step-by-step instructions on how to resolve the issue based on where you purchased your subscription.

### Official website

First of all, please check if you recieved a confirmation email. Subscriptions are always tied to the email address you provide during the payment process. If you recieved the email, then it's possible that you logged into the app with a different email, which is why the app doesn't recognize your purchase.

1. Go to AdGuard VPN → *Settings* → *Account* and check which email address is displayed there
1. If it's different, log out of your account (on iOS and Android, tap the three dots in the top-right corner to log out)
1. Log back in using the correct email address associated with your purchase

If you didn't receive the confirmation email, you may have entered a non-existent email address or made a typo when purchasing your subscription. To resolve this issue, please contact our support team at support@adguard-vpn.com with the following information:

- Date and exact time of purchase
- Exact amount charged
- Last 4 digits of the card used
- If available, attach a receipt or bank statement to your email. This will help us process your request faster

You can use a specific subject line for your email to help us prioritize your request.

### In-app purchase on iPhone or iPad

When activating your AdGuard VPN subscription on an iPhone or iPad, you might encounter one of the following scenarios:

1. Your subscription works on your iPhone, but you can't activate it on another device because you don't know which email address it's associated with
1. You purchased through the App Store but can't find the subscription

Let's look at these two situations separately.

#### Doesn't know what email is used for the subscription

If you logged into AdGuard VPN using *Continue with Apple* and purchased the subscription in-app, it is likely tied to a random email address.

1. Go to AdGuard VPN → *Settings* → *Account*
1. If you don't know the email that's shown in *Account* settings, visit the [password recovery page](https://auth.adguard.info/account/recovery_password.html) and request a password reset for the email address Apple created for you
1. Use this email and the new password to log in on other devices

Alternatively, you can contact support and request to transfer your subscription from the random email to your active email address. Please attach proof of purchase (e.g., a receipt) to confirm that you are the rightful owner of the subscription.

#### Can't find the subscription

If your subscription was purchased through the App Store, you might be using a different Apple ID for purchases or have hidden your email from developers. To restore access to your account, we need to identify the email address used. Follow these steps:

1. Go to *Settings* → *Apple ID* → *Media & Purchases* → *View Account*
1. Ensure the email address matches the one you use as your Apple ID
1. If the addresses differ, please send us the email address used in the App Store (support@adguard-vpn.com)
1. If they match, go to *Apple ID* → *iCloud* → *Hide my email*, find AdGuard VPN in the list, copy the email address, and send it to support@adguard-vpn.com. This email usually ends with @privaterelay.appleid.com

Once we receive the email address, we’ll transfer your subscription, and you’ll be able to use the app.

### On a third-party website

We actively collaborate with popular software resellers. After purchasing a subscription, you receive an activation code (a combination of letters and numbers, usually starting with "VPN"). This code must be added to your AdGuard VPN account.

1. If you don’t have an account, create one on the [AdGuard VPN website](https://auth.adguardaccount.net/login.html)
1. Go to the *Licenses* section and click *Bind license*
1. Enter the activation code, and you’re all set
1. Use your account credentials (email and password) to activate AdGuard VPN: launch the app and log in

If you’re already logged in, go to AdGuard VPN → *Settings* → *Account* and ensure the email address matches the one tied to your subscription.

If they don’t match, log out (on iOS and Android, tap the three dots in the top-right corner) and log back in with the correct email address.
