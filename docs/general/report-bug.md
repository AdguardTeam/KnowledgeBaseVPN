If you’ve noticed a bug while using AdGuard VPN, whether it's the release, beta, or nightly version, please report it to us. Here’s how you can do it most effectively.

## Before you start

### When to report bugs

Check that you have the most up-to-date version of the app, and if not, upgrade it: the bug might have already been resolved in the new version.

Check if the bug hasn’t been reported before. We advise paying attention to both open and closed issues.

### How to describe a problem

Try to provide as many details as possible — that'll make it easier for us to reproduce the bug and figure out how to fix it. Here’s what we’re expecting to see in a bug report:

* Your app version
* Your OS version
* When you noticed the problem
* What you were doing or what happened to the app before you noticed the problem. Steps to reproduce it
* Whether it recurred and with what frequency
* Whether you have another VPN or an antivirus software on your device
