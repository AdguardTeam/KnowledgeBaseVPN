AdGuard VPN is available in two versions — free and unlimited. The subscription allows you to use the app without any restrictions on traffic, connection speed and the choice of locations. You can read more about all the advantages of the unlimited version in [this article](free-vs-unlimited.md).

If you have decided to activate a paid subscription to AdGuard VPN, there are three ways to do this:

1. The first option is an in-app purchase. To do this, go to the AdGuard VPN app and tap the arrow in the upper-right corner of the screen. There are three subscription plans to choose from — monthly, yearly, and two-year one. Select the most suitable one and tap "Subscribe".

2. You can also subscribe to AdGuard VPN on [our website](https://adguard-vpn.com/license.html). Choose a convenient subscription option (yearly or monthly) and enter the email address to which the payment receipt will be sent. You can pay for your subscription using your card or PayPal account.

3. Finally, you can purchase a subscription via [AdGuard account](https://my.adguard.com/main.html), if you have one. Log in to your account and select "My Licenses" from the menu bar. Press "Buy AdGuard VPN" and select a monthly, yearly, or two-year subscription. Pay for it using your card or PayPal account. Done!
