## Other useful tips

- Always make sure that you are using the latest version of AdGuard VPN, as updates typically include vital fixes and enhancements.

- Use AdGuard VPN’s full apps instead of browser extensions for a more robust and stable connection.

- If you encounter problems connecting to a particular location, try connecting to an alternative one. If all locations fail to respond, restart the app to refresh the server list.

- Try switching between mobile data and Wi-Fi: the problem may be network-specific.

- If you use AdGuard VPN alongside AdGuard Ad Blocker on mobile, ensure that the *General* or *VPN* operating mode is selected in the app settings.

- If you have connectivity issues, do not enable *Use QUIC* in *Advanced settings*.

If all else fails, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at support@adguard-vpn.com for further assistance.
