Sometimes users have trouble activating their subscription. Below are step-by-step instructions on how to resolve the issue based on where you purchased your subscription.

## Official website

First, check to see if you received a confirmation email. Subscriptions are associated with the email address you provide during the payment process. If you received the email but don't see the subscription in your app, you may have logged in to the app with a different email address.

1. Go to AdGuard VPN → *Settings* → *Account* and check which email address is displayed there
1. If it's different, log out of your account (on iOS and Android, tap the three dots in the top-right corner to log out)
1. Log back in using the correct email address associated with your purchase

If you didn't receive the confirmation email, you may have entered a non-existent email address or made a typo when purchasing your subscription. To resolve this issue, please contact our support team at support@adguard-vpn.com with the following information:

- Date and exact time of purchase
- Exact amount charged
- Last 4 digits of the card used
- If available, attach a receipt or bank statement to your email. This will help us process your request faster

You can use a specific subject line for your email to help us prioritize your request.

## In-app purchase on iPhone or iPad

When activating your AdGuard VPN subscription on an iPhone or iPad, you might encounter one of the following scenarios:

1. Your subscription works on your iPhone, but you can't activate it on another device because you don't know which email address it's associated with
1. You purchased through the App Store but can't find the subscription

Let's look at these two situations separately.

### Don't know what email is used for the subscription

Your subscription may get associated with an email address created for you by Apple. This can happen if you log in to AdGuard VPN through *Continue with Apple* and purchase the subscription in-app.

1. Go to AdGuard VPN → *Settings* → *Account*
1. If you don't recognize the email address you see on the *Account* screen, visit the [password recovery page](https://auth.adguard.com/account/recovery_password.html) and request a password reset for that email address
1. Use that email address and new password to log in on other devices

Alternatively, you can ask support to transfer your subscription from the email address provided by Apple to your active email address. Please include your receipt or other proof of purchase. This will help us verify that you own the subscription.

### Can't find the subscription

If your subscription was purchased through the App Store, you might be using a different Apple ID for purchases or have hidden your email from developers. To restore access to your account, we need to identify the email address used. Follow these steps:

1. Go to *Settings* → *Apple ID* → *Media & Purchases* → *View*
1. Ensure the email address matches the one you use as your Apple ID
1. If the addresses differ, please send us the email address used in the App Store (support@adguard-vpn.com)
1. If they match, go to *Apple ID* → *iCloud* → *Hide my email*, find AdGuard VPN in the list, copy the email address, and send it to support@adguard-vpn.com. This email usually ends with @privaterelay.appleid.com

Once we receive the email address, we’ll transfer your subscription, and you’ll be able to use the app.

## On a third-party website

If you purchased an AdGuard VPN subscription from a software reseller, you should have received an activation code (a combination of letters and numbers, usually starting with "VPN"). To use this subscription, bind this code to your AdGuard account.

1. If you don’t have an account, [create one](https://auth.adguardaccount.com/login.html)
1. Go to the *Licenses* section and click *Bind license*
1. Enter your activation code to bind the AdGuard VPN subscription to your account
1. Open the AdGuard VPN app and log in with your email address and password

If you're already logged in, go to AdGuard VPN → *Settings* → *Account* and make sure the email address matches the one associated with your subscription.
If they don’t match, log out (on iOS and Android, tap the three dots in the top-right corner) and log back in with the correct email address.
