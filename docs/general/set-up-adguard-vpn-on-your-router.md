By setting up AdGuard VPN on your router, you can protect your data on devices where you cannot install VPN apps, such as smart TVs and game consoles.

## System requirements

AdGuard VPN can only be installed on routers that support IPsec.

## How to set up AdGuard VPN on your router

1. In your AdGuard account, select AdGuard VPN
2. Under *Devices*, click *Add router*
3. Select the desired VPN server location and generate credentials
4. In your admin page, go to the router settings
5. Enable *VPN Client* and click *Add VPN server*
6. Select IPsec-client (it may be called IKE; not L2TP/IPsec)
7. Enter the credentials you created in step 3
8. Connect devices to your router
