If you’re experiencing problems connecting to AdGuard VPN, follow these steps to resolve common issues.

## Connection problems on specific Wi-Fi networks

When AdGuard VPN isn’t working properly on a particular Wi-Fi network:

 1. Check the router settings and active services. Some of them may interfere with AdGuard VPN:

 * Other VPNs (running simultaneously)
 * Firewalls (blocking VPN traffic)
 * Network filters (for example, built-in Internet filters on Keenetic routers, refer to the [manufacturer’s guide](https://help.keenetic.com/) for details)

 1. Disable conflicting services and settings

 1. Restart your router and relaunch AdGuard VPN

If the problem persists, please contact the AdGuard VPN support team (**support@adguard.com**).

## Connection issues on one device

Checky system time settings — incorrect date and time may block the app from connecting to the server.

* Enable automatic time synchronization
* Manually set correct time if needed

If the problem persists, please contact the AdGuard VPN support team (**support@adguard.com**).
