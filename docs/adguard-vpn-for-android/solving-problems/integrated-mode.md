AdGuard VPN has the VPN operating mode enabled by default, which uses its own [AdGuard VPN protocol](/general/adguard-vpn-protocol). It provides the best combination of connection speed and security. However, this operating mode does not allow AdGuard VPN and AdGuard Ad Blocker to work simultaneously. The Integrated mode, in turn, uses a special internal protocol, which makes it possible for the two apps to work together. 

### How to enable Integrated mode

If you already have AdGuard Ad Blocker when installing AdGuard VPN, Integrated mode will turn on automatically, thus allowing you to use our applications at the same time. 

If you are installing AdGuard Ad Blocker after AdGuard VPN â€” follow these steps to make using them together possible:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for Android and tap the gear icon at the bottom right of the screen.

2. Go to *Advanced settings* and select *Operating mode*.

3. Switch to *Integrated mode*. Done!
