如果您在使用AdGuard VPN時遇到任何問題，您可以通過傳送應用程式記錄來通知我們。

## 標準日誌收集和發送

預設情況下，AdGuard VPN for Android 使用 **預設** 日誌記錄級別，即有關應用程式運行進程的資料的基本收集。 若要傳送這些日誌，請執行下列步驟：

1. 開啟適用於 Android 的 AdGuard VPN，如果可能，請重複導致錯誤的操作。 請記下此錯誤發生的確切時間。

2. Open **Settings** by clicking the gear icon at the lower right corner → **Support** → **Report a bug**.

3. In the opened form, enter your email address for feedback and describe the error found, including the time when this error occurred. If you can't reproduce the problem, specify as accurately as possible when it last occurred.

4. There is a check mark next to **Send app logs and system info**, which means that when you send a report, you also send logs.
> If for some reason it is more convenient for you to send us logs in another way, you can export them yourself. To do this, go to **Settings** → **Support** → **Export logs and system info**.

## Collecting and sending extended logs

In most cases, the **Default** logging level is sufficient to trace down possible bugs. But there are cases when more detailed technical information about the device and connections is required, and then our support team will ask you to enable the **Extended** or **Extreme** logging level. To send these types of logs, follow these steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for Android and select **Settings** (the gear icon at the bottom right corner) → **App settings** → **Advanced settings** → **Logging level**.

2. In the **Logging level** section, select **Extended** or **Extreme** logging level.

3. Repeat the actions that led to the error and note the time when it occurred.

4. Switch the logging level back to **Default**.

5. Then open **Settings** by tapping the gear icon at the lower right corner → **Support** → **Report a bug**.

6. In the opened form, enter your email address for feedback and describe the error found, including the time when this error occurred.

7. Make sure that there is a check mark next to **Send app logs and system info** and tap **Send**.
> If for some reason it is more convenient for you to send us logs in another way, you can export them yourself. To do this, go to **Settings** → **Support** → **Export logs and system info**.
