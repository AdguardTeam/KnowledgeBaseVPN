Some users can’t use their AdGuard VPN subscription purchased through the App Store. Este problema puede ocurrir en dos casos:

- if an incorrect Apple ID was used for this App Store purchase
- or if you hid your email address from app developers

Para solucionar este problema, sigue estos pasos:

1. Go to iOS Settings → [your Apple ID name] → *Media & Purchases* → *View Account*.
1. Make sure that the email address matches the one you use for your Apple ID.
1. If the email addresses do not match, please email to `support@adguard.com`: describe your problem and provide us with the address used for the App Store.
1. If the email addresses match, navigate to *Apple ID* → *iCloud* → *Hide My Email*, find our app in the list, copy the email address, and send it to `support@adguard.com` along with a description of your problem. Usually, such an email address ends with `@privaterelay.appleid.com` or `@icloud.com`.

Once the support team has the email address you used for the purchase, they’ll transfer your subscription to the correct account and you’ll be able to start using it. They also may ask for additional information to verify that it’s you. Puedes facilitar al equipo de asistencia el recibo de compra de Apple para agilizar el proceso.
