AdGuard VPN浏览器扩展可在Chrome 浏览器，火狐浏览器和Edge浏览器中使用。 UI 和功能在浏览器之间并没有区别，因此下面将概述所有与浏览器的 AdGuard VPN 。

> 请注意，您只能在登录 AdGuard VPN 时使用浏览器扩展。 你可以使用 AdGuard 帐户或通过 Google、Facebook 或 Apple 登录。 在后一种情况下，请确保您的帐户与 AdGuard 帐户绑定相同的电子邮件地址。 如果您有 [AdGuard VPN 订阅](/general/subscription.md)，它将会在 AdGuard VPN 浏览器扩展中自动激活。 如果你没有AdGuard账户， [请点击这里。](https://auth.adguard.com/registration.html)。

要管理您的 AdGuard VPN 浏览器扩展，请：

* 单击浏览器面板上的图标，然后单击三个条纹并选择 *设置*
* 转到浏览器的 *管理扩展* 页面，然后从那里设置你的 AdGuard VPN 。

完成后，您将看到几个在左侧的选项卡：

## 设置

此选项卡中有一些重要设置。 Here you can choose a DNS server to use, add or remove the AdGuard VPN icon from the browser’s context menu, block WebRTC, change the extension's theme, and allow AdGuard to gather anonymized crash reports and technical data.

### Choosing a DNS server

By default, the [system DNS server](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-filtering#what-is-dns) provided by your ISP is selected, but it may compromise your privacy. With AdGuard VPN Browser extension, you can select a DNS server that provides better speed and security, and even blocks ads or potentially dangerous domains. Brief descriptions under the names of DNS servers will help you navigate and make your decision.

## Exclusions

The next tab contains one of the main distinctive features of AdGuard VPN – two modes with separate exclusions lists.

In **Regular mode**, AdGuard VPN by default works on all websites, with the exception of the websites you've added to the exclusions list. In **Selective mode**, vice versa, AdGuard VPN by default doesn't work anywhere. You can add any websites where you'd like it to work to an exclusions list, separate from the one you saw in the **Regular mode**.

When adding a website to the exclusions list, you can enter the website manually or select the **From the list** option. In the latter case, you'll see eight categories (e.g. *Shopping*, *Messengers*, etc.), each suggesting several popular services. You can exclude any of those services in one click, and this action will add to exclusions all domains relevant to that specific service.

### Import and export

Not only can you add and remove websites, you can also transfer ready exclusions lists to other devices where AdGuard VPN is installed. To export your exclusions list, follow the 4-step instruction below:

1. Open AdGuard VPN Browser extension from where you want to export your lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section and click the "Export" button. The `exclusions.zip` archive will be downloaded.
2. There are two `.txt` files inside the archive, one for each of the Regular and Selective lists. Add more exclusions to them, delete the existing ones, rename files, or just leave the archive as it is.
3. When transferring between different devices, send the `.zip` file to the device for import.
4. Open AdGuard VPN on that device. Find the appropriate section, click the "Import" button and select the archive. Done!

## Account

The third tab of AdGuard VPN Browser extension is utterly minimalistic, containing only the email address you used to sign into your account and two buttons, *Manage* and *Sign out*. Clicking the *Manage* button takes you to your personal AdGuard account, where you can see all your current licenses and subscriptions, as well as devices connected to them.

## Support

You can find answers to common questions in the FAQ section, or leave feedback: report a bug if something isn't working as it should, suggest adding a new feature, or discuss AdGuard on any of the many social media platforms.

## About

Another minor tab, where you can check the extension's version, visit the official website, and view the EULA or Privacy Policy.
