Some users can’t use their AdGuard VPN subscription purchased through the App Store. 此问题可能由于以下两种情况：

- 您使用不同的账户进行 App Store 购买
- 您向应用开发人员隐藏了您的电子邮件地址

要解决此问题，请按照下列步骤操作：

1. Go to iOS Settings → [your Apple ID name] → *Media & Purchases* → *View Account*.
1. Make sure that the email address matches the one you use for your Apple ID.
1. If the email addresses do not match, please email to `support@adguard.com`: describe your problem and provide us with the address used for the App Store.
1. If the email addresses match, navigate to *Apple ID* → *iCloud* → *Hide My Email*, find our app in the list, copy the email address, and send it to `support@adguard.com` along with a description of your problem. Usually, such an email address ends with `@privaterelay.appleid.com` or `@icloud.com`.

Once the support team has the email address you used for the purchase, they’ll transfer your subscription to the correct account and you’ll be able to start using it. They also may ask for additional information to verify that it’s you. 您可以向支持团队提供您的 Apple 购买收据，这有助于加快处理流程。
