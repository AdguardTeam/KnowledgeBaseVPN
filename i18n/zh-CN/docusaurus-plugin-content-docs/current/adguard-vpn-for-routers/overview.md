Setting up AdGuard VPN on your router allows you to protect every device connected to your home network. This includes smart TVs, media players, gaming consoles, and other gadgets that don’t support VPN apps directly.

:::note

This option is only available if you have an AdGuard VPN subscription and your router supports IPsec in its _VPN Client_ (**Not** _VPN Server_) settings. If IPsec is not listed in the _VPN Client_ settings, you can try setting up [AdGuard VPN for Linux](/adguard-vpn-for-linux/setting-up-on-a-router). 此方案基于 [TrustTunnel](https://trusttunnel.org/)，是一款由 AdGuard VPN 开发的开源协议，兼容 Keenetic、OpenWRT 及 Asuswrt-Merlin 路由器。
