AdGuard VPN has the VPN operating mode enabled by default, which uses its own [AdGuard VPN protocol](/general/adguard-vpn-protocol). 它提供连接速度和安全性的最佳组合。 不过，本操作模式不允许 AdGuard VPN 和 AdGuard 广告拦截程序同时工作。 The Integrated mode, in turn, uses a special internal protocol, which makes it possible for the two apps to work together.

### How to enable Integrated mode

If you have AdGuard Ad Blocker, Integrated Mode will turn on automatically when you install AdGuard VPN, allowing you to use both apps at the same time.

If you are installing AdGuard Ad Blocker after AdGuard VPN, follow these steps to use them together:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for Android and tap the gear icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

2. Go to *Advanced settings* and select *Operating mode*.

3. Switch to *Integrated mode*. 完成！
