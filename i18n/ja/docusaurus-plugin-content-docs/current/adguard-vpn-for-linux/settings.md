You can manage AdGuard VPN for Linux settings from the command line. To view the current configuration, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config show
```

## VPN mode: TUN or SOCKS5

You can choose how AdGuard VPN routes traffic.

To set the default tunnel mode, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-mode TUN
```

To set the SOCKS5 mode, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-mode SOCKS
```

To set the SOCKS5 port, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-socks-port <port_number>
```

Replace `<port_number>` with the port you want to connect to.

## SOCKS settings

To set the SOCKS listen host, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-socks-host <host>
```

Replace `<host>` with the host you want to use. Using a host other than 127.0.0.1 requires setting a username and password. To set the SOCKS username and password, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-socks-username <username>
adguardvpn-cli config set-socks-password <password>
```

Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your desired username and password. To clear the SOCKS username and password, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config clear-socks-auth
```

## DNS upstream address

To set a DNS upstream, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-dns <server_address>
```

Replace `<server_address>` with the address of your DNS server. To use this DNS server at the system level, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-system-dns on
```

## VPN tunnel routing mode: NONE, AUTO, or SCRIPT

You can choose how AdGuard VPN routes traffic through the VPN tunnel. To set the tunnel routing mode to NONE (no routing), type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-tun-routing-mode NONE
```

To set the tunnel routing mode to AUTO (automatic routing), type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-tun-routing-mode AUTO
```

To set the tunnel routing mode to SCRIPT (custom routing script), type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-tun-routing-mode SCRIPT
```

To create a routes script with proper permissions, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config create-routes-script
```

## Use QUIC

To enable the use of AdGuard VPN protocol based on QUIC (HTTP/3), type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-use-quic on
```

To disable it, set it to `off`.

## Crash reports

If you enable automatic crash reports, AdGuard VPN will notify the developers if something goes wrong. To enable the setting, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config send-reports on
```

To disable it, set it to `off`.

## Update channel

To change the update channel, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-update-channel <channel>
```

Replace `<channel>` with `release`, `beta`, or `nightly`, depending on your preferences.

## Hints

AdGuard VPN can show you hints after executing commands — for example, what to do next or how to fix an error. This setting is enabled by default but you can disable it by typing:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-show-hints off
```

To re-enable it, replace `off` with `on`.

## Debug logging

To report a bug, you may need to share debug logs with the developers or support team. To enable debug logging, type:

```
adguardvpn-cli config set-debug-logging on
```

Disable this setting after exporting logs.

## Show notificatoins

The setting is responsible for the appearance of system notifications when AdGuard VPN is turned on/off or waiting for reconnection, for example:

- A user turns VPN on — the _VPN connected_ notification appears.
- A user turns VPN off — the _VPN disconnected_ notification appears.
- A user is waiting for the VPN connection to be recovered — the _Waiting for connection_ notification appears.

  adguardvpn-cli config set-show-notifications on

## Exclusions

There are two modes. In _General_ mode, websites from the list of exclusions are not routed through VPN. In _Selective_ mode, only websites from the list of exclusions are routed through VPN. There is a separate list of exclusions for each mode.

To read about what you can do with exclusions, write this in the command-line interface: `adguardvpn-cli site-exclusions -h`.

Here are the main options:

1. **add** adds specified exclusions

   Example: `adguardvpn-cli site-exclusions add`, where `%DOMAIN_NAME%` is the website that you want to add to exclusions.

   :::note

   To add many exclusions, you need to list them separated by spaces.

   :::

2. **clear** clears the list of exclusions in the current mode

   Example: `adguardvpn-cli site-exclusions clear`

3. **mode** shows the current mode and allows to switch between them

   Example: `adguardvpn-cli site-exclusions mode selective` (with this command, Selective mode is chosen)

4. **remove** removes one or more exclusions (if separated by commas)

   Example: `adguardvpn-cli site-exclusions remove %DOMAIN_NAME%` where `%DOMAIN_NAME%` is the website that you want to remove from exclusions.

5. **show** shows the current list of exclusions

   Example: `adguardvpn-cli site-exclusions show`
