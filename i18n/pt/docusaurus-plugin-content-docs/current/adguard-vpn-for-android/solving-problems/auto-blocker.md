Starting with One UI 6.1.1 (Android 14), Samsung introduced a security enhancement called _Auto Blocker_, which is enabled by default on the latest Galaxy smartphones. This feature automatically blocks sideloaded apps from unverified sources unless the user manually overrides the setting.

You can download AdGuard VPN for Android from Google Play or install it on your device manually.
