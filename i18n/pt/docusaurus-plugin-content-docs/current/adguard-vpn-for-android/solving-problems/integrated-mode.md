O AdGuard VPN tem o modo de operação VPN ativado por padrão, que utiliza [seu protocolo de código aberto](https://trusttunnel.org/). It provides the best combination of connection speed and security. However, this operating mode does not allow AdGuard VPN and AdGuard Ad Blocker to work simultaneously. The Integrated mode, in turn, uses a special internal protocol, which makes it possible for the two apps to work together.

## How to enable Integrated mode

If you have AdGuard Ad Blocker, Integrated Mode will turn on automatically when you install AdGuard VPN, allowing you to use both apps at the same time.

If you are installing AdGuard Ad Blocker after AdGuard VPN, follow these steps to use them together:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for Android and tap the gear icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

2. Go to *Advanced settings* and select *Operating mode*.

3. Switch to *Integrated mode*. Done!
