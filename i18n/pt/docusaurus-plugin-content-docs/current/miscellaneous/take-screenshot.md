Screenshot is a capture of your computer’s or mobile device’s screen, which can be obtained by using standard tools or a special program/app.

Sometimes a screenshot (or screenshots) is required by support team to better understand the problem, and not everyone knows how to take screenshots, especially of a separate window or a specific screen area on their devices. If you recognize yourself as one of these users, don’t worry. This article will help you as it describes a range of ways to take screenshots on different platforms.

## How to take a screenshot

Here you will find all the necessary hotkeys you should know in order to take screenshots on your computer or mobile device.

### Android

Taking a screenshot on an Android device can be done in various ways — depending on the device model and its manufacturer.

Generally, you should use the following button combination for Android:

+ **Hold down at once the *Volume Down* and the *Power* buttons for 1–2 seconds**

Your Android device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. So, you can find the screenshot in a Screenshots folder in your Gallery.

But, as it has been already said, there can be differences depending on a particular device. Let’s look at other possible combinations:

+ **Hold down at once *Home* and *Power* buttons for 1–2 seconds;**
+ **Hold down at once the *Back* and the *Home* buttons**

On Android 8 and later there is also a possibility to take a screenshot by placing your hand vertically along the left or right edge of your phone and swiping in from that edge with your hand touching the screen.

If this method doesn’t work, check *Settings* → *Advanced* features to enable *Palm swipe to capture*.

Besides, you can always use any special applications for taking screenshots on your devices, for example — *Screenshot Easy*, *Screenshot Ultimate*, *Screenshot Snap*, etc.

### iOS

Any iOS device (barring ancient ones) lets you take a screenshot using standard tools.

To take a screenshot on an iOS device, use the following combination:

+ **Press the *Sleep/Wake* (side) button and the *Home* button at the same time, then quickly release them**

and this one for iPhone X or later:

+ **Press the *Sleep/Wake* button and the *Volume Up* button at the same time, then quickly release them**

Your iOS device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. You can find it in a standard Photo app.

### Windows

+ **To take a screenshot on Windows, press the *PrtScn* button**

On some notebooks you have to hold *Fn* and then press *PrtScn* instead.

*Please note: PrtScn (Print Screen) button can be differently abbreviated on various keyboards — PrntScrn, PrtScn, PrtScr or PrtSc.*

Windows captures the entire screen and copies it to the (invisible) clipboard.

To take a screenshot of an active window, use the following combination:

+ **Hold down *Alt* and press *PrtScn* (or *Fn + Alt + PrtScn* on some laptops)**

To take a screenshot of a specific area, you should use the following combination:

+ ***Hold down *Win* (the Windows button) and *Shift* and press ***S******

After you take a screenshot, it will be saved in the clipboard. In most cases you will be able to paste it into a document that you are currently editing by using *Ctrl + V* button combination. Alternatively, if you need to save the screenshot into a file, you should open the standard **Paint** program (or any other app that can work with images). Paste your screenshot there using the same button combination or by clicking the Paste button (usually in the top left corner of the screen) and then save it.

Windows 8 and 10 let you take a screenshot very quickly with a *Win + PrtScn* combination. As soon as you press these buttons, the screenshot will be automatically saved as a file to your Pictures → Screenshots Folder.

There is also a dedicated program for taking screenshots called *Snipping Tool* that you can find via Start menu among standard programs of your computer. Snipping Tool lets you capture of any area of your desktop or the entire screen. After taking a screenshot using this program you can edit the picture and save it to any folder on your computer.

Besides, you can also try using different apps for taking screenshots on your computer, like **PicPick**, **Nimbus Screenshot**, **Screenshot Captor**, **Snipaste**, **Monosnap**, etc.

### MacOS

To take a screenshot on Mac, use the following button combination:

+ ***Press and hold together ***⌘ Cmd + Shift + 3******

Your Mac will capture the entire screen and save it as a file on the desktop.

To take a screenshot of an active window, use the following combination:

+ **Press and hold together *⌘ Cmd + Shift + 4 + Space bar*.  The pointer will change to a camera icon. Clique na janela para capturar. Pressione o botão Esc para cancelar a captura de tela**

Para tirar uma captura de tela de uma área específica, você deve usar a seguinte combinação:

+ ***Pressione e segure ***⌘ Cmd + Shift + 4******. Arraste a mira para selecionar a área necessária. Solte o mouse ou o trackpad para fazer uma captura de tela, pressione o botão Esc para cancelá-la.

Para fazer uma captura de tela do *Touch Bar* (MacBook Pro), use a seguinte combinação:

+ ***Mantenha pressionado ***⌘ Cmd + Shift + 6******

Seu Mac captura toda a *Touch Bar* e a salva como um arquivo na área de trabalho.

Para copiar uma captura de tela para a área de transferência em vez de salvá-la, mantenha pressionada a tecla *Ctrl* junto com qualquer uma das combinações acima. Em seguida, você pode colar a captura de tela (da área de transferência) em um documento ou imagem que está editando no momento usando a combinação *Cmd + V*.

Você também pode fazer capturas de tela usando **Visualização** e escolhendo **Tirar captura de tela** (da área selecionada, janela ou tela inteira). Com **Preview** você pode salvar suas capturas de tela em JPG, TIFF, PDF e outros formatos de arquivo.
