In some countries, AdGuard VPN is not available in the App Store. If that’s your case, there are two ways to download the app:

- If you do not have any active subscriptions in the App Store, you can **change the region for your current account**

- If you have active subscriptions that you wish to retain, you can **create a new Apple account and link it to the App Store**

### Changing the region for your current account

1. Go to the Apple Account screen and tap _Media & Purchases_ → _View_.

2. Tap _Country/Region_ → _Change Country or Region_.

### Creating a new Apple Account and linking it to the App Store

For users with paid subscriptions in the App Store who only need to download free apps from different regions, creating a new account in another country is a more convenient option. This way, you can use your primary account at the system level on your phone and activate the second account solely for the App Store without needing to log out of your iPhone account.

**Steps to create a new account in a different country:**

1. Visit [https://appleid.apple.com/account](https://appleid.apple.com/account).

2. Enter any first and last name and select a country, like _United States_.

3. Use an email address not linked to any Apple Account. A verification code will be sent to this email.

4. Provide a phone number not linked to any Apple Account for verification.

5. Confirm your email and phone number and press _Next_. That’s it!

Now **link your new account to the App Store**:

1. Go to _Settings_ and tap your name.

2. Select _Media & Purchases_ → _Sign Out_. This will only sign you out of the App Store while keeping you signed in with your Apple Account on your phone.

3. Tap on _Media & Purchases_ again and select _Not [your name]?_ You will be prompted to sign in with a different Apple ID.

4. Enter the email address and password for your new account.

   ![Login \*mobile_border](https://cdn.adguard-vpn.com/content/kb/vpn/ios/app_store/apple_id.png)

That’s it! Now try to [download AdGuard VPN from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-vpn-unlimited-fast/id1525373602) again.

You can always switch back to your default account this way.
