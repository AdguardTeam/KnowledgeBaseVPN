The *Hide My Email* feature is a great tool to keep your real email address private when signing up for websites and apps that use Apple ID. You can even use it for private correspondence and manage all incoming messages just as you would with a regular email account. This way, you can protect your privacy and keep your real email address hidden from prying eyes.

:::note

The feature is only available for iOS 15 and higher and requires an iCloud+ subscription.

To use this feature, go to *Settings* → [Your name] → *iCloud* → *Hide My Email* and follow the on-screen instructions.

You can generate a unique and random email address that forwards incoming messages to your actual address. It might look like this: chimney-floture@privaterelay.appleid.com. There is no upper limit to the number of email addresses you can create. You can categorize them with labels and use each one for different purposes: signing up, receiving newsletters, etc. Apple ensures that the content of messages handled through the *Hide My Email* service is not inspected beyond standard spam filtering.

The *Hide My Email* feature is also available in Apple Mail. To send an email without disclosing your real email address, simply select *Hide My Email* in the *From* field when composing your message.

The *Email Protection* service by DuckDuckGo works similarly. You get an `@duck.com` email address and can create email aliases for sign-ups and newsletters. If these aliases begin to attract too much spam, they can be easily discarded.
