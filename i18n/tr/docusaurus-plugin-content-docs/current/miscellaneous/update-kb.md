title: 'Bilgi Tabanının Güncellenmesi'
sidebar_position: 3
---

Bu Bilgi Tabanının amacı, herkese AdGuard VPN ile ilgili her türlü konuda en güncel bilgileri sağlamaktır. Ancak işler sürekli değişiyor ve bazen bir makale artık mevcut durumu yansıtmıyor - her bir bilgiyi takip edecek ve yeni sürümler yayınlandığında buna göre güncelleyecek çok fazla kişi yok.

Bu nedenle, tüm BT içeriğimizi [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN)'a yerleştirdik ve şimdi kelimenin tam anlamıyla herkes, mevcut makalelere ve tamamen yeni makalelere düzenlemeler ve çeviriler önererek katkıda bulunabilir.

## Bir değişiklik önerme veya yeni bir makale yazma {#suggest-change}

You can suggest changes to current articles and add new ones to the Knowledge Base using the functionality of the GitHub mentioned above. If you are unfamiliar with principles of working with the platform, start by reading [documentation in this section](https://docs.github.com/en).

Once you are ready to start, work in [the KnowledgeBaseVPN repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN). All texts in our Knowledge Base are written in `Markdown` markup language. Keep this in mind when editing or writing articles. Follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to learn more about Markdown syntax.

The Knowledge Base website is built using Docusaurus 2 — a modern static website generator. When suggesting changes or additions, take into account that all documents must comply with the principles of the platform. You can read about them in [the guide available via this link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides).

You can deploy this Knowledge Base locally to your computer to preview the changes you suggest. Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found [in the README.md file](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN/blob/main/README.md) on this Knowledge Base's GitHub page.

## Translating articles {#translate-adguard}

Translation of the existing articles of the Knowledge Base is carried out on [the Crowdin platform](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-vpn-knowledge-base). All the details about translations and working with Crowdin can be found [in the dedicated article](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-translations) of the AdGuard Ad Blocker Knowledge Base.

When working on AdGuard VPN Knowledge Base articles, you may meet strings containing plural forms that you should translate with extra attention. [In a separate article](https://kb.adguard.com/en/miscellaneous/plurals), we described in detail the difficulties that can arise when translating strings with plural forms, and gave extensive instructions on how to work with them on the Crowdin platform.

## Working on open issues

Sometimes there exist [open tasks](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseVPN/issues/) related to updating the Knowledge Base. You can help us speed up their completion [the same way](#suggest-change) you would suggest any other changes to this Knowledge Base. Choose any issue that you find appealing and start working on it. If you have any questions — you can ask them right in the comments to that issue.
