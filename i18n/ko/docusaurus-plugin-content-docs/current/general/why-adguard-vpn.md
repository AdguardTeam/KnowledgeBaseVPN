When getting ready to commit to a [long-term VPN subscription](subscription.md), users most frequently evaluate its speed, security, and price. Those are very important points but there is so much more! AdGuard VPN has a dozen of key assets that make it 'the better option'.

*To start with, let’s go over AdGuard VPN’s unmatched features that you won’t find in any other VPN.*

## 1. 독점 프로토콜
From the very outset, we resolved to develop and deploy an in-house VPN protocol instead of picking a canned solution — that’d be too easy, plus, we weren’t satisfied with existing protocols. The result has become the [AdGuard VPN protocol](adguard-vpn-protocol.mdx).

Choosing a VPN service, people often face a trade-off between fast vs. safe. The AdGuard VPN protocol is a perfect blend of speed and security, so you don’t have to bear slow internet connection or make privacy sacrifices. Among other things, it disguises itself as regular traffic and it’s much harder to detect and block it.

## 2. 예외 목록
The *Exclusions lists* allow you to select sites for which the VPN should be enabled and for which — disabled. There are two operation modes in AdGuard VPN: *General* and *Selective*. In *General mode*, VPN works everywhere except websites added to exclusions. And vice versa, in *Selective mode*, VPN works nowhere but on websites added to exclusions. You can also easily import/export exclusions lists. Read about this feature in *Features overview* for the product you are interested in.

You can add websites to exclusions manually or choose them among the lists of popular services. The lists are divided into eight categories: Social networks, Messengers, Video and Music streaming services, Games, Shopping, Search engines, and Work communication tools.

> This feature is available on all platforms except iOS.

## 3. DNS 서버 선택
No more relying on the DNS server provided by your ISP by default! First, it’s not safe: your ISP most likely has access to your browsing history. Second, People often underestimate DNS, yet it can remove ads and trackers, protect your device from malware or, for instance, enable safe search and block adult content.

You can choose DNS servers from [known DNS providers](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-providers) such as AdGuard, Cisco, Cloudflare, Google, or Quad9, or even configure to use your own DNS server.

## 4. 가장 빠른 위치

Another feature that makes AdGuard VPN stand out from the crowd is that you can select a location based on its ping. In a nutshell, ping is the time it takes the data packet sent from your computer to reach the server and return. When in doubt, use a rule of thumb: the lower the ping, the closer the server, the higher its speed. We are constantly expanding the number of locations so that you can choose from a variety.

> Note that to access all VPN server locations, you need to purchase an AdGuard VPN subscription.

## 5. AdGuard 광고 차단기와의 호환성

With desktop apps and browser extensions this goes without saying — there’s rarely any conflicts between apps, save for antiviruses and other similarly oriented software.

With mobile devices, on the other hand, it’s not that simple. In the vast majority of cases, two VPN-based apps will not work together, just because certain OS-induced limitations exist that prevent that from happening, both on Android and iOS.

However, we managed to find a solution to befriend AdGuard VPN and AdGuard Ad Blocker. When you have both AdGuard apps installed on one device simultaneously, they will automatically become compatible without any input required from you. This is a unique opportunity to take advantage of two sets of features, which you would normally have to choose between.

## 6. QUIC 지원
[QUIC](https://adguard.com/en/blog/dns-over-quic.html) is a cutting-edge protocol that has many perks. The main advantage is it can improve connection quality in non-ideal conditions – for example, on mobile devices or when connecting to public Wi-Fi. Although the new protocol won’t affect speed when the connection is fine and stable, it will definitely make the situation better for users with slow internet.

*Now let’s switch to the item set that any decent VPN can't do without.*

## 7. 킬 스위치
Kill Switch is essential if you, for instance, often use a mobile network or connect to public Wi-Fi networks in malls, cafes, on the subway or at the airport. For the simple reason — if VPN will suddenly drop and the connection will become insecure, chances are that your sensitive information will be exposed to fraudsters or cyber criminals.

If for some reason your VPN connection is interrupted, Kill Switch will automatically disconnect the internet connection, keeping attackers away from seizing your information. With Kill Switch, rest assured that you are in safe hands. If you’re concerned about privacy or at least value your personal data, don’t overlook this bulletproof method.

## 8. 분할 터널링
This feature resembles the exclusions lists mentioned above. The only difference is that here you can exclude apps instead of websites.

## 9. 자동 보호
This feature has been developed specifically for unsecured networks. For the convenience of users, we made it impossible to forget to enable VPN when visiting public places. Should you pop into a coffee shop and connect to a local Wi-Fi network, you’ll be automatically connected to AdGuard VPN.

## 10. 한 번에 최대 5개의 연결된 장치
AdGuard VPN offers five simultaneous connections to its paid users. We place special emphasis on the word *simultaneous*, and here is why. 일부 VPN 제공업체는 *최대 5개의 기기*에서만 서비스에 로그인할 수 있습니다. With AdGuard VPN, *there’s no limit* to the number of devices that can be logged in to your account, but you can have five VPN connections enabled at the same time. Those who don’t have a subscription can use AdGuard VPN on *two devices*, which gives us another trump card to play against competitors — most of the VPN services only have *one device* in their free versions.

## 11. 보안 스트리밍
Streaming services don't like VPNs for obvious reasons: according to statistics, about 20% of users install a VPN mainly to watch shows, TV shows and movies bypassing geo-blocking. That's why streaming platforms tend to do everything they can to track VPN traffic and block it.

But what if you want to feel safe while watch content specific to your region? Or don't want stop watching exciting series even when you travel to another country? The answer is simple — AdGuard VPN, which thanks to its unique protocol can remain invisible to services.

이 기능은 특별히 언급할 가치가 있습니다. 많은 사용자들이 다크 모드를 원하기 때문에 모든 AdGuard VPN 제품에 테마 테마를 추가했습니다. Choose the one you like more — light, dark or system default. 다크 테마가 마음에 드셨으면 좋겠습니다.
