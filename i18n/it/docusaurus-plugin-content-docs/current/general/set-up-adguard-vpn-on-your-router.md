Setting up AdGuard VPN on your router allows you to protect all devices connected to your network. This includes smart TVs, media players, gaming consoles, and other gadgets that do not support VPN apps directly.

:::note

This option is only available if you have an AdGuard VPN subscription and your router supports IPsec in its _VPN Client_ (**Not** _VPN Server_) settings. If IPsec is not listed in the _VPN CLient_ settings, you can try setting up [AdGuard VPN for Linux](/adguard-vpn-for-linux/setting-up-on-a-router). This solution uses AdGuard's proprietary protocol and is compatible with Keenetic, OpenWRT, and Asuswrt-Merlin routers.

## How to set up AdGuard VPN on your router

1. In your [AdGuard account](https://auth.adguard.com/login.html), select AdGuard VPN.

2. Under _Devices_, click _Add router_.
