## Što je VPN i zašto Vam je potreban

VPN Vam omogućuje uspostavljanje sigurne veze s nekom drugom mrežom na Internetu.

Inicijalno su VPN-ovi kreirani s jednom svrhom - Sigurno povezivanje poslovnih mreža putem interneta kako bi se ljudi mogli povezati na poslovnu mrežu iz vlastitog doma. Ova se tehnologija koristi za mnoge druge stvari: Primjerice za anonimno pregledavanje interneta ili za zaštitu Vaših aktivnosti od znatiželjnih očiju dok koristite javnu Wi-Fi mrežu.

VPN spaja korisnikovo računalo ili mobilni uređaj na poslužitelj i omogućava da osoba pregledava internet koristeći nečiju tuđu IP adresu. Stoga promatrači treće strane ne mogu vidjeti korisnikovu stvarnu IP adresu, zbog čega je gotovo nemoguće pratiti korisnika.

Speaking of VPN, the first thing they mention is traffic encryption and security deriving from it. But what does it mean? A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the remote server. All your web traffic passes through this tunnel, so your data is protected along the way. For the external observer, your traffic exits the VPN server, so it looks like your device has the IP address of this server. This trick masks the user's identity and true location.

VPN can be used to:

* hide your real whereabouts and stay anonymous
* secure your data — even when connecting to a public Wi-Fi, you can browse the Web safely
* protect yourself from spoofing (network traffic interception) and tracking on the part of your Internet service provider

Passwords, card details, and just plain personal information are at risk when a user surfs the Internet. But if you connect to the global network using a VPN, you can be sure that no one can intercept your data.

## Why AdGuard VPN

### Trusted developer
AdGuard has been present on the market of personal data protection and ad blocking and developing its line of software for more than 12 years. Over this time, our company has built an impeccable reputation, and the number of our customers has exceeded 30 million.

### Unique VPN protocol
The main difference between AdGuard VPN and its competitors is that we use [our own developed protocol](/general/adguard-vpn-protocol.mdx). It disguises itself as normal traffic, so it is much more difficult to track and block it.

### No logs policy
No logs policy means that we don’t collect, store or transfer users’ personal data to third parties. The full text of AdGuard privacy policy can be found [here](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/privacy.html).

### Tracking protection
Web traffic from any user may be of interest and is particularly valuable in terms of monetization of personal data. Both criminals and unscrupulous ISPs can access it. However, with a trustworthy VPN, you can be confident that neither your provider nor anyone else will see your internet activity.
