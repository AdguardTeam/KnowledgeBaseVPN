## What is a VPN and why do you need one?

VPN Vam omogućuje uspostavljanje sigurne veze s nekom drugom mrežom na Internetu.

Initially, VPNs were created to securely connect business networks over the Internet, so that people could connect to the corporate network from home. Ova se tehnologija koristi za mnoge druge stvari: Primjerice za anonimno pregledavanje interneta ili za zaštitu Vaših aktivnosti od znatiželjnih očiju dok koristite javnu Wi-Fi mrežu.

VPN spaja korisnikovo računalo ili mobilni uređaj na poslužitelj i omogućava da osoba pregledava internet koristeći nečiju tuđu IP adresu. Stoga promatrači treće strane ne mogu vidjeti korisnikovu stvarnu IP adresu, zbog čega je gotovo nemoguće pratiti korisnika.

Speaking of VPN, the first thing they mention is traffic encryption and security deriving from it. But what does it mean? A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the remote server. All your web traffic passes through this tunnel, so your data is protected along the way. For the external observer, your traffic exits the VPN server, so it looks like your device has the IP address of this server. This trick masks the user's identity and true location.

VPN can be used to:

- Hide your real whereabouts and stay anonymous
- Secure your data — even when connecting to a public Wi-Fi, you can browse the Web safely
- Protect yourself from spoofing (network traffic interception) and tracking on the part of your Internet service provider

Passwords, card details, and just plain personal information are at risk when a user surfs the Internet. But if you connect to the global network using a VPN, you can be sure that no one can intercept your data.

The main difference between AdGuard VPN and its competitors is that we use [our own developed protocol](/general/adguard-vpn-protocol). It disguises itself as normal traffic, so it is much more difficult to track and block it.

### Tracking protection

Web traffic from any user may be of interest and is particularly valuable in terms of monetization of personal data. Both criminals and unscrupulous ISPs can access it. However, with a trustworthy VPN, you can be confident that neither your provider nor anyone else will see your internet activity.
